# Plugin management page
## About
I am creating a simple plugin management page from the book "Professional WordPress Plugin Development" 
<br/>The reason for going back to this exercise is to be able to better understand the plugin fuctions, hooks, etc so that when I go back to my plugin I am creating from scratch, I will be able to understand what is needed and how it works better.<br/>
I will be documenting in the code each part and if I understand the code and how it works.
